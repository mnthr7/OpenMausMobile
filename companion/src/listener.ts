// is what turns on authentication and turns off the routes a phone has no
// business calling.
//
// Two listeners rather than one bind on 0.0.0.0, deliberately. A single
// socket cannot tell "the desktop app on this machine" from "something else
// on the coffee-shop wifi" — `req.socket.localAddress` is 127.0.0.1 for both
// when a 0.0.0.0 listener is reached over loopback. Separate sockets make
// the distinction structural instead of a guess, so the trusted path stays
// exactly as trusted as it was before this file existed.
