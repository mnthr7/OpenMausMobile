// The forwarding half of the sidecar.
//
// A device's request arrives here, is checked against the allowlist, and is
// replayed to the harness on 127.0.0.1 as a request from this machine. The
// response comes back scrubbed.
//
// The reason this works with an unmodified harness is worth stating plainly,
// because it is the whole basis of the design: the harness rejects any
// request whose Host is not loopback — a DNS-rebinding defence — and a
// request this process makes to 127.0.0.1 satisfies that by construction. So
// the sidecar does NOT forward the device's Host or Origin. It speaks to the
// harness as itself, from the machine the harness is already willing to
// serve. Nothing upstream has to change, or even know this exists.
