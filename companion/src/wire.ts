// `resumeCursors` is the harness's own bookkeeping: the native session id to
// resume, per instance, per task. It goes out on every bot payload and every
// `bot` SSE frame. That is harmless noise while every client is the machine
// itself, and stops being harmless the moment a client is a phone on someone
// else's wifi.
//
// Upstream may fix this at source — there is a PR open for it — at which
// point this becomes a no-op rather than a lie, which is the right way for a
// sidecar to depend on someone else's API: assume nothing, and be correct
// either way.

 *
 * - **It must not swallow blank lines.** The blank line *is* the event
 *   terminator; a transform that normalises whitespace produces a stream
 *   that parses to nothing and looks perfectly healthy at both ends.
 * - **It must not wait for more than one event.** Buffering to a frame
 *   boundary is bounded and fine. Buffering for a fixed size or a timer
 *   turns a live stream into a batch one, and the symptom is a phone that
 *   sits on "Connecting…" while the server logs a healthy connection.
 *
 * `id:` lines are preserved verbatim: they are the resume cursor, and
 * rewriting them would silently break `?since=`.
