// App Settings → Companion. Turning this on starts the companion sidecar: a
// separate process that opens an authenticated port a paired phone can
// reach. Everything else in the app keeps talking to 127.0.0.1 exactly as
// before, and the harness itself is untouched.
//
// The sidecar is separate on purpose — it is the only thing here that
// listens off this machine, and keeping it out of the harness is what lets
// the harness stay loopback-only. That is an implementation detail from this
// panel's point of view, which is the point: a toggle, a code, a list of
// devices. Nobody should need a terminal to use their phone.
//
// The panel is deliberately blunt about what it does. "Your bots can run
// shell commands" is the honest reason a network switch here deserves a
// sentence of explanation rather than a bare toggle.
