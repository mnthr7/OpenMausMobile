// A bot's computer, live.
//
// The harness already screenshots a working bot every few seconds and pushes
// the frame to any client that asked for it. This is that, and nothing more:
// no clicking, no typing, no control. Watching is the useful half on a phone
// — you want to know what it is doing, not to do it yourself on a screen the
// size of a playing card.
//
// Frames are expensive (hundreds of kilobytes of base64 each), so they are
// off unless this view is on screen. `watchScreen` reopens the stream asking
// for them and `stopWatchingScreen` reopens it asking not to; both resume
// from the cursor, so the reconnect costs nothing but a round trip.
