// real responses captured from a running server, and the decoding tests
// read them. When the server changes a payload, a test here fails.

// Everything the server may omit is optional, and nothing is decoded more
// strictly than it has to be — a phone that refuses to show a conversation
// because one message gained a field is worse than one that ignores it.
