// fold is the part worth testing, and it should be testable without a
// server, a socket, or a UI.
//
// The harness has already turned provider events into settled messages, so
// the work here is small — append, patch, replace. That is the whole reason
// a phone client is a weekend of work rather than a rewrite.
